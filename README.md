Hi, I'm LÃ¡zaro J. SuÃ¡rez, or Musashi98, a computer scientist & fullstack developer. I'm interested in the latest frameworks for backend and 
frontend development, and building sweet web sites and mobile apps. Currently learning all I can about the MERN stack, but knowledge about 
other stacks are welcome as well. Y also like Vue, .NET Core, and other programing languajes like C, C++, C# and assembly ones. You can reach 
me at LinkedIn by my name or email me at lsuarez.hav.cub@gmail.com, would like to collaborate in any interesting project ðŸ™‚.
